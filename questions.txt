Visa Q&A
Q) Which visa are you on ?

A) I am on an F-1 visa with a STEM-OPT (Optional Practical Training) extension, which is valid for 5 years.

Breakdown:

1) 2 years for a Master's in Computer Science (4 semesters) (completed on 17 dec 2025)
2) 1 year of OPT directly after graduation (currently I am on this, since i have a job starting from 2 feb 2026)
3) 2 years of STEM-OPT extension after OPT (at the employer's discretion ie if I continue the job)

Q) What about the H-1B $100K fee issue ?

A) That fee only applies if you are entering the US on an H-1B visa, 
not for me ie (for existing F-1 or H-1B visa holders). 

For me, it is just a change of status since I don't need to appear 
for a visa interview at my home country's consulate.

Q) So does this increase or decrease your odds of securing an H-1B ?

A) Yes, this increases my odds since companies now have to hire 
from the existing talent pool in the USA, 
as there is no $100K fee for US-based candidates. 
If they hire someone who is not in the USA, they have to shell out $100K for them.
