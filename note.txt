Just wrapped up the Aya AI Hackathon in NYC and built something I'm really proud of.

I created a full-stack implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from scratch using Elixir and Phoenix. It's a tool-augmented AI agent that pulls real-time crypto prices from CoinGecko, CoinCap, and Coinbase simultaneously, then uses Gemini to make sense of it all.

The cool part? I built the entire MCP server and client without using any external MCP libraries. Just pure JSON-RPC 2.0, OTP supervision trees, and parallel API aggregation with fault tolerance. Plus a real-time Phoenix LiveView UI that updates instantly without page reloads.

It's production-ready with proper error handling, concurrent workers, and an agentic loop that lets the AI make recursive tool calls. 

Code is open source if anyone wants to check it out. https://github.com/ozzyozbourne/aya-hackathon
